## Handle Connection & Check Response

The function `handle_connection` in `src/main.rs` reads incoming HTTP requests using a `BufReader`. It processes the request by:
- Reading the stream line by line using `.lines()`
- Mapping the result with `.map(|result| result.unwrap())`
- Stopping when it encounters an empty line with `.take_while(|line| !line.is_empty())`
- Storing the request as a `Vec<String>`, which contains each line of the HTTP request

## Returning HTML

In this update, we modified `handle_connection` to return an HTML page (`hello.html`) as an HTTP response.  
The response is sent with a **200 OK** status, and the content is read from a file.  
The important changes in `handle_connection`:
- Reads `hello.html` using `fs::read_to_string("hello.html")`
- Formats HTTP response with **Content-Length**
- Sends the response to the client using `stream.write_all(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();`

## Validating Request and Selectively Responding

In this milestone, we implemented request validation and selective responses:
- If the request is `"GET / HTTP/1.1"`, it serves `hello.html`.
- If the request is anything else, it serves `404.html` (or a default error message).
- The function `serve_file` reads the requested file and returns either **200 OK** or **404 NOT FOUND**.

## Simulation of Slow Request

In this milestone, we simulated a slow server response by introducing a delay:
- If a request is `"GET / HTTP/1.1"`, it serves `hello.html` instantly.
- If a request is `"GET /sleep HTTP/1.1"`, it **waits 10 seconds** before responding.
- If a request is invalid, it serves `404.html`.

**Opinions:**
- When `/sleep` is requested, all other requests to the server are delayed.The server is **single-threaded**, meaning it can only handle one request at a time. This demonstrates the need for **multi-threading** in real web servers.
